			A Student Management System (SMS) is a software application designed to streamline and automate the administrative tasks of educational institutions. It helps schools, colleges, and universities manage student data efficiently, including enrollment, attendance, grades, and personal information. By centralizing this information, administrators and teachers can access accurate records quickly, reducing paperwork and minimizing errors.
